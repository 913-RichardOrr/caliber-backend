# caliber-backend

## Introduction
  This project is a mobile version of the Caliber application which is a performance management suite used to collect and analyze evaluations of Revature trainees with the goal of increasing transparency, fostering informed decision making, and creating actionable information. Caliber takes input for any quality checkpoint from the beginning to the end of the associate lifecycle (screening, training, QC, panel, etc). The Caliber suite also provides a variety of reports on different levels of granularity using visual dashboards and tabular data.
  
  Caliber Mobile closely resembles the web version which was previously created by the internal dev-team at Revature but is styled and tailored instead to a mobile environment, including both Web and Android builds for phone usage.
